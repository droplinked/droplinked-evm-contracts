Add your network to the hardhat.config.ts file, by simply looking at the exapmles that are there
Put your etherscan api key in the etherscan part
Run the following command to deploy :
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network $network_name_here$
For instance, running

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network polygon_mumbai
or run

npm run deploy:mumbai
would result in something like this
